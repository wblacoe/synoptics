# Synoptics

...is a program that automatically reads the (King James version of the) Bible. It then analyses the 4 gospels in the New Testament to see how strongly they align.

Compare its output to the [this article](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/harmony?lang=eng) and [this article](https://www.lds.org/study/ensign/1974/09/harmony-of-the-four-gospels?lang=eng) on the harmony of the synoptic gospels. They both show alignments along all 4 gospels in a table which roughly correspond with those in the programs output.

`bible.txt` was copied from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mxw/grmr/master/src/finaltests/bible.txt). Unfortunately it is missing a title for Genesis and the Bible overall. But the program's reader works around this and names Genesis "Unknown Book".
